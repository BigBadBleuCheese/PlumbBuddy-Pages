          There are two rules we would like you to be aware of before joining:
          1. **No pirated game support**<br />We offer support for current, legal game versions only. Outdated game versions, pirated games or packs, DLC unlockers, etc. are not supported for various reasons.
          2. **No support if you are using mods depicting rape, bestiality, or pedophilia**<br />Please be aware that if those files are found in your error report, we reserve the right to ban you **instantly** and **without warning** depending on the severity.
          Please make sure to read ALL rules when you join.
