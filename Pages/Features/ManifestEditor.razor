                            The <strong>Components</strong> step in the Manifest Editor allows you to add as many package and script archive files that you need to, and even shows you the folder structure they have on your computer.

                            Each file can be marked by you as required by your mod or optional for the player.
                            When a file is required, you can even add caveats relating to packs or other mods.
                            PlumbBuddy can be instructed to ignore a requirement just because the player has or doesn't have some other content.

                            It will even tell them about requirements they've suddenly gained <em>just because</em> they installed something new today, even though they installed your mod months ago.

                            And secondly, tools that merge packages generally have <em>no idea</em> about manifests.
                            We know some of you guys like to do that as a convenience for players, so to handle that use case without any errors, we chose to make them tuning so they don't clobber each other.

                            You can use this to ensure the player has only picked one file from a set of options, or, in cooperation with another creator, make sure only one of your mods is installed.
                            Mod files can also have multiple exclusivities if you've been particularly busy.

                            The <strong>Requirements</strong> step deals with not just one of your mod's files, but the whole mod.
                            You can require that the player has (or doesn't have) certain packs.
                            Don't worry if you can't remember all the pack codes and don't want to look them up; there's a convenient switch to make all the pack code fields in the editor fun, searchable drop-down lists.
                            You can also require that the player has a certain mod installed, and if it's a mod that declares its features, even specify the features your mod needs.

                            The reason why is because if PlumbBuddy finds that a player is missing a pack, it will direct them to EA for the collection of corporate blood money.
                            But before it does, it will show your code to the player and offer to copy it to their clipboard so they can easily paste it in at checkout.
                            It will even pat them on the pack for supporting creators. ðŸ’–

                            It features links that describe the kinds of things which would cause the version number to change.
                            These links will adjust the version number accordingly for you.

                            When your mod is running on a player's computer, PlumbBuddy will double-check to make sure that the required mod still offers those features.

                            So, mods may or may not have versions in their manifests... players are constantly renaming files all the time... <em>how does PlumbBuddy know whether things are okay?</em>
                            The answer is that inside each manifest is a crazy long number that was computed using the things in that mod file.

                        <MudTextM3>
                            Scaffolding files are YAML and fully commented, so if you're curious open them up and have a look.

                            Since scaffolding files are there to help you update your mods quickly and easily, it would be best if you took care of them just like your own mod files.
                            Keep them where they were written and back them up along with everything else.
                            It's not game over if you lose them, but it will be a little annoying having to re-add all your mod files again later.

                            Scaffolding files include information specific to your computer.
                            You are <strong>strongly advised</strong> not to deploy them to players along with the rest of your mod's files.
                            They won't be doing the players any good and might expose elements of the structure of your computer's file system.
                            I don't know all of you personally, but <em>I can imagine</em> how some of you <em>could</em> be embarassed.
